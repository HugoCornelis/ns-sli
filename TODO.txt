*** Executing src/nsgenesis './/tests/scripts/heccer/springmass.g'
*** Test: Does the application report that it writes its output?

output written
genesis #0 > *** Test: Can we perform a test using asc_file objects to write application output?
*** Application output file: /tmp/a1
*** Expected output file: .//tests/specifications/strings/a1.txt

* Read in and implement a test for the morphology file tests/scripts/readcell/Purk2M9-nospines.p and tests/scripts/readcell/Purk2M9-spines.p


* remove the need for "hardcoded_neutral" in the scripting language.


* need to get showfield working, this should be trivial with the tools in nscomm.c

* need to make nsgenesis seek out the neurospaces model enviroment variable upon startup.

* move the genesis script library from startup into the library package.
