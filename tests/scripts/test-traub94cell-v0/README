This is an updated version of the cells/traub94 simulation scripts found at
genesis-sim.org in the Models archives, and within the "Ultimate GENESIS
Tutorials Distribution".  The cell is model of a burst-firing hippocampal
pyramidal cell using 64 asymmetric compartments in a branched geometry.

The K_C conductance has now been modified to use a tabchannel, and some
changes have been made to allow it to run without graphics under GENESIS 3.
The default simulation applies a 0.5 second current injection pulse to the
soma of the cell, and outputs the soma membrane potential to a file.

The files are:

traub94cell.g - the main script
graphics.g - graphics functions to be included if graphics flag is set
protodefs.g - creates prototype channels and elements in /library
traub94chans.g - function defs to create the channels, included by protodefs
traub94.p - cell parameter file with 64 asymmetric compartments
traub94-default_Vm.out - soma Vm using default simulation parameters (GENESIS 2)

These are the default definitions at the beginning of the main script,
which can be modified:

str outfile = "traub94_Vm.out"
int batch = 1 // if (batch) run simulation with default injcurrent, tmax
int graphics = 0     // display control panel, graphs
int file_out = 1     // write output to a file
int hflag = 1	 // GENESIS 2 - use hsolve if hflag = 1
int chanmode = 3 // hsolve mode for GENESIS 2

The Traub'94 simulation has been implemented by Pulin Sampat
(Brandeis University) and by Patricio Huerta (MIT) with
help from Dr. Roger Traub.

CHANGES FOR TRAUB94

The Traub91 simulation has been modified to incorporate the new
model by Traub, et. al. [Journal of Physiology, Vol. 481.1, p. 79
(1994)].  Basically, the new model should replicate (almost exactly)
the '91 results.  Some of the new features of the model are:
1.  Implementation of dendritic branching.  The model now has
    sixty-four soma-dendritic compartments.
2.  Implementation of an axon initial segment, and an axon compartment.
3.  Model is constrained using antidromic stimulation.
4.  Implementation of spines on dendritic compartments.  This was
    done by doubling the area (in his paper).  However, to incorporate
    this in GENESIS, I had to double CM, halve RM, and double the
    ionic conductance densities for each compartment.
5.  I have not yet implemented synaptic channels.
6.  Time step is 2.5 microseconds; much smaller than the 1991 paper.
    So the simulation is a lot slower, when used with non-hsolve methods.
There are other subtle changes; please refer to the paper for the
differences.

Additional comments by Dave Beeman (dbeeman@dogstar.colorado.edu)

As this model has a large number of compartments, it should be run using
one of the implicit integration methods (method 10 or 11), using hsolve.
This will allow a step size of about 25 microseconds, instead of the
2.5 microsecond step required for the default method 0.  This is illustrated
in the script "traub94.g", which uses hsolve with chanmode 1, and method 11
(Crank-Nicholson).  The "userprefs.g" file included here allows it to
be used with Neurokit.

README		This file
CA3.p		The cell parameter file for the model
traub94proto.g	File defining functions to create the library of channels
traub94.g	Script to run the model with chanmode 1 and method 11.
		At the cost of increased execution time, the "make_xcell"
		statement near the end of the script may be uncommented to
		create a display of the cell.  This requires GENESIS 2.1
                or later.
userprefs.g	Used to run the model under Neurokit.  NOTE: This requires
		the version of Neurokit provided with GENESIS 2.0.1 or later.
