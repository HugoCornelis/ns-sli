These are bare-bones versions of the simple two-compartment cell model in
scripts Tutorials/cells/simplecell from the GENESIS Modeling Tutorials
package.  They both use a prototype definition file and a cell parameter
file to be read with readcell.

simplecell-0.g - no spikegen or synchans - uses cell0.p and protodefs0.g
simplecell-1.g - has spikegen and synchans - uses cell1.p and protodefs1.g

They are designed to be run interactively, typing "quit" when finished.
This allows the model to be explored after the 0.5 sec run is completed.


The genesis/Scripts/neurokit/prototypes directory must be in the GENESIS 2
or 3 SIMPATH in order to include the compartment and channel prototype
scripts.
