This directory contains the files of the 1992-1994 version of my Purkinje
model (P2M9).  They require GENESIS2.1 or higher to run.

See http://www.bbf.uia.ac.be/models/PM9.shtml for general model info.

You should start up the simulation with one of the script files in all caps:
CLIMBSPINE9.g: simulates a complex spike in vivo
CLIMB9.g: simulates a complex spike in vitro
CURRENT9.g: simulates a somatic current injection protocol in vitro
ISPINE9.g: simulates irregular firing due to combined parallel fiber and
	   inhibitory inputs in vivo
SYNCHRONORM9.g: simulates the firing response to a synchronous parallel
		fiber input in vivo
SYNCHROPASS9.g: simulates the EPSP evoked by a synchronous parallel
		fiber input in vivo


All these scripts use additional files:
Purk_const.g: contains the most important parameters for the model
Purk_chan.g: sets up the channel kinetics.  Points either to:
	Purk_chansave.g: run this the first time, will create a set of
			 binary (-> machine-dependent) .tab files with
			 tabulated channel kinetics
	Purk_chanload.g: once the .tab files are created you can point
			 Purk_chan.g to this file.  It runs much faster.
        Note: if you use GENESIS2.2 the .tab files are no longer machine-
              dependent.
Purk_*comp.g: sets up the prototype compartments.  Different versions
	      add different sets of synaptic channels.
Purk_syn.g: sets up the synaptic channel kinetics.
Purk2M0*p: different versions of the same morphology file without channels.
Purk2M9*p: different versions of the same morphology file with active
	   channels.  Difference in presence of spines (Purk2M9s*p, with
	   different distributions) or not (Purk2M9.p).
