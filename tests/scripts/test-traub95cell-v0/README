This is an updated version of the cells/traub95 simulation scripts found at
genesis-sim.org in the Models archives, and within the "Ultimate GENESIS
Tutorial Distribution".  The cell is model of a fast spiking hippocampal
interneuron, using 51 asymmetric compartments.

The K_C conductance has now been modified to use a tabchannel, and some
changes have been made to allow it to run without graphics under GENESIS 3.
The default simulation applies a 0.5 second current injection pulse to the
soma of the cell, and outputs the soma membrane potential to a file.

The files are:

traub95cell.g - the main script
graphics.g - graphics functions to be included if graphics flag is set
protodefs.g - creates prototype channels and elements in /library
traub95chans.g - function defs to create the channels, included by protodefs
traub95.p - cell parameter file with 51 asymmetric compartments
traub95-default_Vm.out - soma Vm using default simulation parameters (GENESIS 2)

These are the default definitions at the beginning of the main script,
which can be modified:

str outfile = "traub95_Vm.out"
int batch = 1 // if (batch) run simulation with default injcurrent, tmax
int graphics = 0     // display control panel, graphs
int file_out = 1     // write output to a file
int hflag = 1    // GENESIS 2 - use hsolve if hflag = 1
int chanmode = 3 // hsolve mode for GENESIS 2

This is a version of Traub's 51-compartment hippocampal interneuron,
contributed by Eliot Menschik.  This, and the traub94 model pyramidal
cell are described in the papers:

Menschik, E. D. and Finkel, L. H. (1998) Neuromodulatory control of
hippocampal function: Towards a model of Alzheimer's disease. Artificial
Intelligence in Medicine 13:99-121.

Menschik, E.D. and Finkel, L.H. (1999) Cholinergic neuromodulation and
Alzheimer's disease: from single cells to network simulations. Progress in
Brain Research, 121:19-45.

The files are:

traub95.p - the cell parameter file
protodefs_traub95.g - file containing the channel definitions

Note, this cell, like the Traub94 cell still suffers from the fact
that the K_C current depends on using the vdep_object which is not
supported by hsolve in other than chanmodes 0 and 1.  Ideally, the
implementation of this current should be modified to use the GENESIS
2.2 tabchannel "instant" field as was done in
genesis/Scripts/traub91/traub91proto.g.

If you carry out this relatively simple modification (which will speed up
the simulation), please contribute it to BABEL.
