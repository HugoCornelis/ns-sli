    <h1>Functional Tests for the Genesis 2 backward compatibility bridge for Neurospaces</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for the Genesis 2
    backward compatibility bridge of Neurospaces, the input to the
    test, the expected output for the test, and the command to start
    the application.

    <p>

      These tests give a good idea of what we mean with backward
      compatibility: running Genesis 2 scripts without modification.
      The level of testing is functional, ie. user experienced
      functionality (ie. no low-level unit tests).

      These are integration tests between the Genesis SLI, model container 
      and heccer.
