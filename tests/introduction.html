    <h1>Functional Tests for Neurospaces</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for Neurospaces, the
    input to the test, the expected output for the test, and the
    command to start the application.

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of what Neurospaces does.
      The level of testing is functional, ie. user experienced
      functionality (ie. no low-level unit tests).
